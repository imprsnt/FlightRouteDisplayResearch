* Application Name: Flight Diversion display mockup
* Version:	1.0
* Developer: Prashant Barnawal
* description: reads a template xml that has flight routes and displays them as several types of displays 
* message: This application was developed overnight for a friend of mine who was researching on  different types of flight 
		   diversion displays. The application reads an xml template (Template.xml added) that describes flight routes and other overheads. Displays
     	   six types of views in tabular text and in 2D visual format. The UI is developed in Qt 5.1 (crash coursed in 2 hours) and the
		   views are displayed with OpenGL. I accept that the project was developed quickly and is very dirty. BUT I LOVE IT :)
		   ***You need to have the Qt runtime and openGl to run the application
